Using default tag: latest
Error response from daemon: manifest for sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown



The error message `manifest for sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp:latest not found: manifest unknown` indicates that Docker is attempting to pull the `latest` tag for the image, but it doesn't exist in the repository.

---

### Explanation:
- Docker images use tags to specify versions or variants (e.g., `1.0`, `v2.1`, `stable`).
- If no tag is explicitly specified, Docker defaults to `:latest`.
- The error suggests that the repository `sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp` does not have an image tagged as `latest`.

---

### Solution:

1. **Check Available Tags on Docker Hub**:
   - Visit the Docker Hub repository: [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/).
   - Log in and navigate to the `sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp` repository to find the available tags (e.g., `v1.0`, `stable`).

2. **Update Deployment YAML with Correct Tag**:
   - Once you identify the correct tag, update your `nginx-deploy.yaml` file:
     ```yaml
     containers:
     - name: argocd
       image: sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp:<tag>
       ports:
       - containerPort: 80
     ```

   Replace `<tag>` with the actual tag name (e.g., `v1.0`):
   ```yaml
   containers:
   - name: argocd
     image: sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp:v1.0
     ports:
     - containerPort: 80
   ```

3. **Reapply the Deployment**:
   - Apply the updated configuration:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f nginx-deploy.yaml
     ```

4. **Verify Pods**:
   - Check the status of the pods:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```

---

### Validate the Image with Docker:
Test pulling the image locally with the specific tag:
```bash
docker pull sakshirathoree/argocd-course-webapp:<tag>
```

If this succeeds, Kubernetes should also be able to pull the image.

### Key Note:
If you are unsure about the correct tag and the repository is private, ensure you are logged in to Docker Hub and confirm the tags using the web interface. Let me know if you face further challenges!
