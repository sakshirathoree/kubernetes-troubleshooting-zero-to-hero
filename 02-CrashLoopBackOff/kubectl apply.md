When you run the command `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`, several steps happen in the backend to create or update resources in the Kubernetes cluster. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **1. Client-Side Actions**
#### **Command Execution**
- `kubectl` parses the YAML file and validates its syntax to ensure it’s a well-formed resource definition.

#### **API Request Creation**
- `kubectl` communicates with the Kubernetes **API Server** using a REST API request. It sends the deployment specification defined in the `deployment.yaml` file as part of the HTTP request to the API server.
- The request includes details about the resource (`Deployment` in this case), namespace, and the desired state of the application.

---

### **2. Server-Side Actions**

#### **API Server Validation**
- The **API Server** receives the request and validates it:
  - Is the resource type (`Deployment`) valid?
  - Is the namespace valid?
  - Does the user or service account running the command have the required permissions (via Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)?

#### **Persist the Desired State in etcd**
- Once validated, the API server stores the desired state of the deployment in the cluster's **etcd** database, which acts as the single source of truth for the cluster.

#### **Controller Assignment**
- The **Deployment Controller**, part of the Kubernetes Control Plane, is notified about the new or updated deployment.

---

### **3. Deployment Controller Actions**
The Deployment Controller takes the desired state and works to ensure the actual state of the cluster matches it:

#### **ReplicaSet Management**
- The Deployment Controller checks if there’s an existing **ReplicaSet** associated with the deployment:
  - If this is a new deployment, it creates a new ReplicaSet.
  - If this is an update, it creates a new ReplicaSet and scales down the old one as part of the **Rolling Update** strategy.

#### **ReplicaSet Creation**
- The ReplicaSet specifies the desired number of replicas (pods) for the application.
- The Deployment Controller ensures the ReplicaSet is created and scaled to match the `replicas` field defined in the YAML.

---

### **4. Scheduler Actions**
The **Scheduler** identifies the nodes in the cluster where the pods should run. It considers:
- Resource requests (e.g., CPU, memory) in the YAML file.
- Node availability and constraints (e.g., taints, tolerations, node selectors).

Once a suitable node is found for each pod, the scheduler assigns the pod to that node.

---

### **5. Kubelet Actions**
On each node, the **Kubelet** (a node-level agent) takes over the pod assigned to that node:
1. **Pull Container Images**:
   - The Kubelet checks if the container images specified in the `deployment.yaml` are available locally. If not, it pulls them from the container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR).
   - If `imagePullSecrets` is provided, the Kubelet uses it for authentication with private registries.

2. **Start Containers**:
   - The Kubelet interacts with the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) to start the containers as specified.

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - The Kubelet continuously monitors the health of the containers to ensure they are running as expected.

---

### **6. Pod Lifecycle**
- The pods are created and scheduled across the cluster.
- Kubernetes monitors the state of the pods and ensures that the number of running replicas matches the desired count.

---

### **7. Ongoing Reconciliation**
Kubernetes continuously reconciles the **desired state** (stored in etcd) with the **actual state** of the cluster:
- If a pod crashes or a node fails, the Deployment Controller ensures new pods are created to replace the failed ones.
- If you update the deployment (e.g., change the image or replica count), the controller initiates a rolling update.

---

### Summary of Backend Components Involved:
1. **kubectl**: Parses YAML and sends API requests to the API Server.
2. **API Server**: Validates the request and stores the desired state in etcd.
3. **etcd**: Acts as the cluster’s database to store the desired state.
4. **Deployment Controller**: Manages the deployment and ensures the ReplicaSet matches the desired state.
5. **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes.
6. **Kubelet**: Runs and manages pods on the nodes.
7. **Container Runtime**: Pulls images and starts containers.

This process ensures Kubernetes maintains the application’s desired state and handles updates, failures, and scaling.
